/*!
Integration test for buffer access performance regression bug.

This test reproduces the issue where `Buffer::access_write().await` becomes 10x slower
when no concurrent graphics operations are happening.

Original issue locations:
- `engine/petrucci/src/lib.rs:204` - The slow `vehicle_geometry.access_write().await` call  
- `src/engine.rs:106` - The camera translate that "fixes" the performance

Performance measurements from original issue:
- WITHOUT camera movement: ~90-100ms per buffer access
- WITH camera movement: ~5-20ms per buffer access

Expected behavior: Buffer access should be consistently fast regardless of other graphics activity
Actual behavior: Buffer access is 10x slower when graphics pipeline is "idle"
