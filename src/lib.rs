# Higher-order memory types

The main innovation of IW is providing an obvious family of higher-order kinds of buffers and textures.

These types are layered atop traditional GPU buffers/textures, but are customized
for specific usecases, such as multibuffering or synchronization.  Because each type encodes
its usecase information, the behavior can be optimized in a usecase-specific way.

Examples include:

| Class    | Use case       | Potential optimizations                 | Multibuffering | Synchronization      |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Static   | Sprites, etc   | Convert to a private, GPU-native format | Not needed     | Not needed           |
| Forward  | Write CPU->GPU | Unified vs discrete memory              | Builtin        | Builtin              |
| Reverse  | Write GPU->CPU | Unified vs discrete memory              | Builtin        | Builtin              |
| Sideways | Write GPU->GPU | private, GPU-native format              | Builtin        | TBD                  |


# Backends

In the interests of getting going, current development targets [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs)
as backend, so we inherit its broad support for DX12, Vulkan, Metal, WebGPU, Angle, WebGL, etc.

On the other hand, I have intentionally designed IW to support multiple backends, and have prototyped
Vulkan and Metal-based approaches myself.  I intend to stand up other backends as I need them.  If
you need them before I do, get in touch.

Longer-term I am skeptical of wgpu as a backend.  I am skeptical I can meet native performance expectations
with a web-based API, I am skeptical of wgpu's guidance on accepting contributions to solve these issues,
and I am skeptical of any single graphics API as I've seen them come and go while I'm supporting an
application.

A substantial motivation for creating IW is to design an API that can solve these problems and
become a practical and performant target for my own applications.  In the short term, I need
features/optimizations that don't happen in design-by-committee APIs.  In the long term, I need to
maintain my applications after APIs have been deprecated.  IW is the middleware to bridge
this gap in one place.

If you are motivated enough to consider writing your own solution, I would love to have your help
here instead.
